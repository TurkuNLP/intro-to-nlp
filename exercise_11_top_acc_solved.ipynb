        "really evaluate this properly, even though we do have a nice test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the exercise, your task will be to evaluate the method using the simple \"top-k accuracy\" metric. This is a simple metric, which measures whether the correct target is among the first K nearest neighbors. In other words for the pair of source-target words $w_{fin}, w_{eng}$ we consider the transfer successful, if $w_{eng}$ is among the K nearest neighbors of the embedding we obtain by transforming $w_{ fin}$ with the matrix $M$. Top K accuracy then is the proportion of successfully transferred pairs, out of all pairs, as a percentage.\n",
