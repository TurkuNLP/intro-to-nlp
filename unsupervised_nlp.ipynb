    "<font color=\"grey\">Lanugage modeling recap: Consider a simple statistical model that estimates the probability of a word given a number of previous words in a text. For instance, given the words *the dog loved to*, the model would deem it much more likely that the next word is _play_ than any word that does not fit semantically or syntactically (e.g., *green*, _played_ or *code*). The probability _p(play | the dog loved to)_ is much higher than for most other words. Such a model can be implemented as a machine learning model, typically a neural network that can take into account a long context, and be trained over large amounts of text. Language models that have a large number of internal trainable parameters can learn complicated regularities of natural language, by learning to accurately predict the next word in a sequence.</font>\n"
