This is the format in which many of the `sklearn` functions need the data. Since you will be classifying the data, you should split it randomly to train and test sections.\n",

        "(2) **Vary the ngrams features for the SVC classifier**: Experiment with varying number of ngram features fed into the classifier (hint: read the documentation of sklearn CountVectorizer https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html). The classifier is a linear SVC classifier. What ngram range works best, and what is the performance of the best classifier?\n",
